<h2 id="career-story">Career Story</h2>
<p>My resume and relevant links are posted above, but if you&rsquo;d like to know a bit more about my career, here&rsquo;s my career path from today and back to when I came out of university.</p>
<h3 id="data-science">Data Science</h3>
<p>After a few years in IT working with code and technology, I got a bit more comfortable in my day to day and wanted to challenge myself again. I was using JavaScript every day, with a mix of other web development tools, ServiceNow, and sometimes I would use SQL and Python to do deeper data analyses. When I reflected, this was the work that I enjoyed most. Getting to the answer tough questions that decide where our efforts get directed, challenging the &ldquo;vibes&rdquo; and the &ldquo;trust mes&rdquo; to find real ways of improving, that was the most satisying work.</p>
<p>Naturally, I gravitated toward data science. I started teaching myself through Udemy, YouTube, and other online resources, as I did with the other technical aspects of my IT job, but I wanted to learn more and get a deeper knowledge of all the math underneath, so I enrolled in a bootcamp. It was COVID, and I had a lot of free time so I dove in and had a lot of fun. It taught me a lot about how to be a good data practioner and definitely sent me in the right direction on my learning path, but didn&rsquo;t scratch the theory itch that I had, so now I am pursuing a Master of Data Science and Analytics degree at the University of Calgary. It&rsquo;s been fun to connect statistics, calculus, and linear algebra knowledge I learned in university to the data techniques I&rsquo;ve been using, and I&rsquo;m looking forward to learning more!</p>
<h3 id="it-developer">IT Developer</h3>
<p>I moved on to the Information Technology department of a Managed Service Provider for a local hospital system came my way. The position was business analyst and they wanted someone who could do process analysis and technical project management for their upcoming transition from CA Service Desk to ServiceNow for their IT Service Management platform. Though I had traded chemicals for tickets, it was remarkable how similar it was to write out a process flow for IT as compared to manufacturing. There were new technologies and frameworks for thinking about them like ITIL, but the goal was still the same, to make things work better than they do today.</p>
<p>Eventually, we lost a few technical staff and I offered to pick up some of the smaller tasks as a challenge. I learned JavaScript, SQL, and some other web development tools. The next thing I knew, I was exclusively doing development work. I became an expert on Service Catalog forms and automated workflows, then we needed more up to date organization data, so I learned integrations, next the data we needed was in the CMDB so I got to learn all about our device discovery processes. I even spent some time embedded with our cloud operations team as a consultant, helping them integrate Google Cloud Platform to our ServiceNow instance, and adding governance processes for their tag/labels. I brought best practices, documentation, and DevOps methodologies to our team. I still work here today, as a Senior ServiceNow Developer.</p>
<h3 id="engineer">Engineer</h3>
<p>I started my career as a temporary employee at Estee Lauder shortly after I graduated university. My first job was as a lab technician in a skincare lab, making batches of different lotions and creams, and iterating the ingredients or process to lock in on the desired final product.</p>
<p>I was able to move into the engineering team as a process engineer a few months later doing scale up work on potential new products. It was a fun environment with a lot of young colleagues, folks genuinely excited about the work they did. I learned a lot about cosmetic products, how much goes into a brand, and of course, how to make them. It was really rewarding to see a product you had worked on out on the store shelves, and best of all when that product was brand new and we weren&rsquo;t even sure if we could make it. Those innovation challenges were rewarding, but I always liked provess improvement work the best. It was fun to figure out what parts of a process were essential, and which were borderline superstition traced back to a formulation chemist 20 years ago. Cutting process time down really felt good and &ldquo;engineer-y&rdquo;. I even snuck in some Python coding in this job, using openpyxl to run calculations and format sheets, with matplotlib to make graphs for my reports.</p>
