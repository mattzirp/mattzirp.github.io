# What Matt Harrsion Taught Me About Pandas

I first discovered Matt Harrison's work a few years ago when I made a concerted effort to learn the Python library pandas as expertly as I possibly could. Something from the Zen of Python that I feel often goes by the wayside is "There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it." If you've read any amount of the vast entry level sphere of Data Science how-tos, you'll know that this isn't how things are presented. 

That's what's so refreshing about Matt's work. He's got an opinion, there is a right way to do it, and he's here to share it. Following his advice his untangled my code, and made it much less daunting to return to my work
