    <description><![CDATA[<h2 id="background">Background</h2>
<p>I first discovered Matt Harrison&rsquo;s work a few years ago when I made a concerted effort to learn the Python library pandas as expertly as I possibly could. I was doing a lot of data work at the time, and wanted to feel more confident and get more efficient working through long lists of servers from various systems in our environment. I had previously adopted the mentality that Python was a tool I was using to get things done. Sure, I tried to work some best practices into my code: using version control, doc strings, commenting some of my less intuitive lines, but a lot of other best practice advice features around shipping modules or apps, not data analysis. As a result, I would often share charts or export results to Excel, but I would never share my notebooks, and most times they wouldn&rsquo;t even run beginning to end, so good luck, future me!</p>]]></description>
